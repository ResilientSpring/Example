/* Keynote: 
 * In the Java language, classes can be derived from other classes, 
 * thereby inheriting fields and methods from those classes.
 * 
 * Definitions: 
 * A class that is derived from another class is called a subclass (also a derived class, 
 * extended class, or child class). The class from which the subclass is derived is called a superclass 
 * (also a base class or a parent class).
 * 
 * The idea of inheritance is simple but powerful: When you want to create a new class and 
 * there is already a class that includes some of the code that you want, 
 * you can derive your new class from the existing class. 
 * 
 * In doing this, you can reuse the fields and methods of the existing class without having to write 
 * (and debug!) them yourself.
 * 
 * A subclass inherits all the members (fields, methods, and nested classes) from its superclass. 
 * Constructors are not members, so they are not inherited by subclasses, 
 * but the constructor of the superclass can be invoked from the subclass.
 * 
Private Members in a Superclass:
A subclass does not inherit the private members of its parent class. 
However, if the superclass has public or protected methods for accessing its private fields, 
these can also be used by the subclass.

A nested class has access to all the private members of its enclosing classâ€”both fields and methods. 
Therefore, a public or protected nested class inherited by a subclass has indirect access to 
all of the private members of the superclass.
